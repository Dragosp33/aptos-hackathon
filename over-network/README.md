# Overnetwork Challenge – Part 1 (NFT-Based Social Platform)

This was my most complex and rewarding challenge from the Overmind Aptos Hackathon.

## 🔧 What I Built

- Implemented smart contracts in Move to manage user accounts as NFTs
- Enabled follow/unfollow logic, posting, commenting, and liking
- Used structs like `AccountMetadata`, `Publication`, and `GlobalTimeline`
- Built and tested the full NFT-driven logic for a decentralized social network

## 📚 What I Learned

- Move struct/resource patterns and access rules
- Pagination, state handling, and error design on Aptos
- How to structure social dApps with on-chain data ownership

## 📁 Structure

- [`over-network-clpwaevi40008js08mghcpclk`](./over-network-clpwaevi40008js08mghcpclk)contains the actual Move code and supporting files
