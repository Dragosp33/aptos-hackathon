# 🧠 Aptos Hackathon Submissions – Overmind 2023

This repository contains my submissions to the Overmind Aptos Hackathon, where I completed multiple challenges across Move smart contracts, decentralized app development, and full-stack blockchain integrations.

Over the course of the event, I:

- 🚀 Completed **3 challenges**, focusing on both smart contracts and frontend development.
- 🧩 Built an **NFT-based account and publication system** entirely in Move.
- 🔗 Integrated on-chain logic with modern frontend stacks (React, Next.js, Tailwind, Wallet adapters).
- 🛠️ Learned and applied advanced Aptos primitives, error handling, pagination, and real-time event tracking.

## 🔍 Challenge Summaries

### 1. [`over-network`](./over-network)

> **NFT-Based Social Platform (Move Smart Contract)**  
> My most advanced and complete challenge. I built a decentralized social media system on Aptos using Move, with:

- NFTs representing user accounts
- Resource-based ownership of posts, comments, and likes
- Global timelines, error management, and access control

Smart contract-only — no frontend. View my [README](./over-network/README.md) for details.

### 2. [`over-network-part2`](./over-network-part2)

> **On-Chain Auth System – Frontend Quest**  
> Completed a React/Next.js-based authentication UI for on-chain user management. Integrated Overmind-provided wallet libraries and Move contract calls.

- Implemented login/logout, user creation, and blockchain profile syncing
- Worked within Overmind's provided frontend architecture

I preserved the original Overmind quest [README](./over-network-part2/over-network-part2/README.md) for clarity.

### 3. [`pay-me-a-river`](./pay-me-a-river)

> **Streaming APT Payments DApp – Frontend Quest**  
> Built a dApp frontend for a payment-streaming contract using:

- Wallet adapter integration
- View functions and event listeners via Aptos API
- Dynamic React UIs with Tailwind and shadcn/ui

This was a great exercise in real-time blockchain interaction and event-driven UX.

See [README](./pay-me-a-river/README.md) for my breakdown, and Overmind's original instructions [here](./pay-me-a-river/pay-me-a-river-remastered-clpwaevi40008js08mghcpclk/README.md).
